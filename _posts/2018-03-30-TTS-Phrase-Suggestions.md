excerpt: Submit offensive phrases for when the Beta release comes this week!
---

I'm working on a new game inspired by the text to speech feature of twitch and that old game we play every now and then with our friends.  Essentially, you and another player pick phrases for each other to be read out loud on the opposing player's phone.  If that player doesn't stop the text to speech, they get the opportunity to do the same to the other player.  The game continues until one person ends the text to speech.

---

Naturally, this is meant to have some very toxic/edgy/offensive phrases that you can choose from.  I could come up with some, but I thought it would be better if the people playing the game could choose the phrases.  Because of this, I have set up a form where you can submit phrases to get added to the game.  The app uses an online database so if I add your phrase, it can be used immediately without updating.  

The form collects your email so I can notify you when your phrase gets added.  If you don't want me to know your email, just put anything.  The best fake email so far is buttlicker69@gmail.com who submitted the phrase, "Eat my butt, Brody".  

Thanks in advance for submitting phrases!  And remember, no amount of offensive is too offensive.  Beta release coming out in the next week is all goes as planned so get those phrases in!
