# Rotating Curves around the X-Axis
## Brody Eller

You can use the integral of a curve to calculate the volume of an area by rotating it around an axis.

When you find an integral, you find the area under a curve.  If you were to take an integral at a single point on a curve, you'd get it's distance from the x-axis.  You can then take this distance and put it into the equation for area of a circle, &pi;r<sup>2</sup>.

Building on this, if you find a definite integral across a certain range, you can use that value to find the volume of a solid revolved around the x-axis.
