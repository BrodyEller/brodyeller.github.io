A game made for the Ludum Dare 39 Compo.

You have embarked on a road trip.  You must drive to the red flag to rest before continuing your road trip.  Collect fuel along the way, you donâ€™t want to run out.  Crashing into buildings will cause you to lose some fuel.  Each fuel canister lasts 30 seconds.  Use WASD or the arrow keys to move.  Good Luck!

## [Current Release version 1.1.0.](https://github.com/BrodyEller/Blackout/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
